#Study Delight 

Be it in university or at work, many of us rely on to-do lists/other planner tools to keep track of our tasks.

Many to-do list apps/ productivity tools only allow us to list down the tasks and tick-off completed tasks but do not help us visualise how we can complete them over a week. Some of us use physical book-planners to achieve this purpose, but it can sometimes be inconvenient to bring the book around or we may forget to bring it everywhere we go. Moreover, on physical planner books, it is impossible to ‘postpone’ the tasks from one day to another without making unsightly strike-offs and there is limited space for us to make many different changes as well.

Hence, we wanted to create our own ideal version of a to-do list tool, which allows us to visualise our action plan to complete the tasks over the week, and make adjustments to our weekly plan easily and neatly if we are not able to complete planned tasks for the day.

We hope to make scheduling tasks more efficient and engaging (delightful) through an online platform.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
